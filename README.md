					Specialty Department Wine/Cheese Wiki (Vinipedia? Wineapedia? Drunki? Nah, that sucks...)

	The purpose of this project is to build a Wikipedia style website where people can look up different types of wine
(Most likely by grape type), and see cheese or other food pairings that would go with that wine. Those cheeses would link over to their own
pages where you could find more information and pairings, and so on.
	At the very least I want this project to be a decent reference for people to look at that will help them make a purchase decision, learn
about food and beverage, or even help build a cheese board for a party. As this project progresses I want to add more functionality via JavaScript
(to the best of my current abilities), which would include users being able to add and edit pages and linking over to popular creameries or vineyards to
find more information. As well as adding pages about beers, spirits, and foods to add to the pairing options.
	This is a subject I feel passionate about so I will make changes, improvements, and add features as my web development skills 
improve. For the moment it will mostly be done with HTML and CSS with limited JavaScript functionality. I hope for this project to mirror my growth as
a developer, as well as my general knowledge on the subject.

		

		Special Thanks to Melissa, Sam, Emma, and the rest of the team for my inspiration to do this.
