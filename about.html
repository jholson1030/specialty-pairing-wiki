            <!--Talk about how this project was founded to help myself learn-->
                <p>I started up this project on September 1st of 2022. As of the time of writing this I am about five months
                    into learning web development and I wanted to try my hand at something on a larger scale. All of my other
                    projects have been only a few pages and a few small applications so my hope is that I can expand my knowledge
                    of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I by no means expect this to turn in to a professional, widely used website nor will
                    I ever even consider it to be a true "Wikipedia Clone". In all actuality this is for my own personal growth, and I 
                    am fine with that. <br> <br>
                    <!--Get rid of run on sentence-->
                    In my day job I have the opportunity to work closely with cheese, beer, spirits and wine and it has been a wonderful opportunity
                    for me. There is so much to learn and I often feel lacking in my knowledge base, especially with wine. Of course there
                    are endless resources out there to help with this. Books, websites, YouTube channels, courses could all explain the information much 
                    better then I ever could, but I decided to use my (limited) skills in web development to create a project that could let me research the 
                    topic myself, and put it to print. Thats all I could ever hope to accomplish with this, and in the small possibility that this helps 
                    someone else out there who is looking to learn a little bit about wine, then I would be fine with that. <br> <br>
                    I will try to keep all major updates in the <a href="#">News Section</a>. Any questions, comments or suggestions can be directed to
