            <h1>Merlot</h1>
            <p>One of the most popular types of wine. Considered America's second most loved wine.</p>

            <h2>General Info</h2>
            <p>The basic tasting profile for Merlot is that it's very dry, medium bodied, medium to high in tannins, and 
                has a fair amount of acidity. It's primary flavors include cherry, stone-fruit, chocolate, vanilla and bay leaf.
                It can sometimes be mistaken with Cabernet Sauvignon and it often blended with it in Bordeaux wines. It is an
                early maturing wine but some can be left to age for decades.
            </p>
            <h2>Popular Merlot Wines</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#">Duckhorn Three Palms 2017</a></li>
                <p>From Napa Valley, California. In the vinyard volcanic rock absorbs the heat of the sun, protecting
                    the grape from cold mornings. Vanilla and oak forward, continued with plum and blackberry. Very bold
                    and dry with a little bit of acidity.
                </p>
                <li><a href="#">J. Lohr Estates Los Osos 2016</a></li>
                <p>From Paso Robles, California. This vintage was lucky to have winter rains that helped ripen the grape
                    giving it a more juicy acidity. Vary light and fresh with notes of violets, blueberry, plum, and French 
                    oak spices. 
                </p>
                <li><a href="#">Realm The Tempest 2017</a></li>
                <p>From Napa Valley, California. It is a Bordeaux inspired blend with mostly merlot grapes followed by cabernet sauvignon,
                    cabernet franc, and petit verdot. A very complex wine that is energetic and fresh. Notes of spicy blueberry, blackberry,
                    and black cherry with slight hints of violets and smoke. 
                </p>
            </ul>
            <h2>Cheese Pairings</h2>
            <p>Merlot pairs with a wide variety of cheeses-- from sharp aged cow's milk to light soft brie due to how less
                dry this wine is compared to Cabernet Sauvignon. Merlot is a good wine to be creative with when you go to
            pick a cheese or a charcuterie board to pair with it.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Gorgonzola</li>
                <li>Brie- either cow or goat</li>
                <li>Camembert</li>
                <li>Cheddar</li>
                <li>Any aged goat cheese will go great with Merlot</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Other Food Pairings</h3>
            <p>Like pairing with cheese, Merlot is a versatile wine to pair with. If it helps, just keep it simple. this
                is a good wine to use to enhance weekday 30 minute meals.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pizza</li>
                <li>BBQ Chicken</li>
                <li>Pasta- tomato or cream based</li>
